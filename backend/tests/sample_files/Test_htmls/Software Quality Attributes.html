<p>In this part of the course on software design and architecture we will cover an often-underestimated yet critical dimension: Software Quality Attributes. Software Quality Attributes describe the non-functional requirements of a software system. While functional requirements define the "what" aspect (like features or functionalities), quality attributes focus on the "how" aspect. They specify how well the system performs its functions. Quality attributes give us insights into characteristics like the system's reliability, maintainability, performance, and more. They play a pivotal role in ensuring that software systems are robust, resilient, and meet users' expectations in real-world conditions.</p>
<p>In this foundational video and the ones that follow, we'll delve into some key Software Quality Attributes, exploring their intricacies and importance. The material covering the Software Quality Attributes will contain overview and purpose of each quality attribute, tactics which can be used to achieve the quality attribute, and general design and implementation considerations. System and software quality attributes are covered by the <a class="inline_disabled" title="Link" href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:25010:ed-1:v1:en" target="_blank">ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standard</a> and this series of videos will only cover a few of the many available Software Quality Attributes, namely:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: The degree to which a system is operational and accessible when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Modifiability</strong>: The ease with which a system can accommodate changes without introducing defects.</li>
<li><strong>Integrability</strong>: How seamlessly various components or systems can be combined to function cohesively.</li>
<li><strong>Testability</strong>: The degree to which a system can be effectively tested to ensure it meets requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Evaluates how efficiently a system responds to user requests and handles its workload.</li>
</ol>
<p>These attributes not only shape the way software is developed but also significantly influence user satisfaction and system longevity.</p>
