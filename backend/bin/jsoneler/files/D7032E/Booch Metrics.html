<p>This video covers Booch's metrics, a seminal framework in software design that aids in evaluating and refining the architecture of software systems. Grady Booch's insights into these metrics provide a roadmap for understanding and optimizing software design quality. As we venture into the video, here's a brief primer on the five metrics you'll encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Coupling</strong>: Measures the degree of interdependence between software modules. Lower coupling is generally favored as it implies modules can operate more independently, enhancing maintainability and scalability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cohesion</strong>: Refers to how closely the responsibilities of a single module are related to one another. Higher cohesion suggests that a module is focused and easy to understand, modify, and maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sufficiency</strong>: Assesses if the provided components of a system offer enough functionality to satisfy its requirements. A system is deemed sufficient if its architecture supports its intended behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Completeness</strong>: Gauges whether all required components of the system are present and correctly interact with each other. A complete system doesn't leave any required aspect or functionality unaddressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primitiveness</strong>: Evaluates the simplicity of components. It encourages software design where complex functions are composed of simple, single-purpose operations, promoting ease of testing and reusability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
