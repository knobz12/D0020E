<h3>Solution: E-Commerce System Design</h3>
<p><strong>1. Software Quality Attributes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Modifiability:</strong> The design of the `Payment` class makes it susceptible to frequent changes as new payment methods might be introduced or existing ones modified. The code should be structured in a way that minimizes the ripple effects of these changes. For example, segregating different payment methods into separate classes or employing a strategy pattern can help in isolating changes and improving modifiability. <br><strong>Testability:</strong> Currently, the methods within the `Payment` class do not return any value, which makes unit testing challenging since the outcome of a payment method cannot be directly validated. By having methods return a result (e.g., a success or failure status), it becomes clearer to test and validate each method's behavior. Additionally, the direct instantiation of objects within the classes might make it difficult to mock external dependencies. Employing dependency injection can make the classes more test-friendly, allowing for the substitution of real implementations with mock ones during testing.</p>
<p><strong>2. SOLID Principles:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Single Responsibility Principle:</strong> The Payment class currently handles multiple payment methods. This can be refactored by having a base Payment interface and then creating separate classes for each payment method, adhering to the SRP. <br><strong>Open/Closed Principle:</strong> By adopting design patterns like Strategy for Payment methods, we can ensure that our system is open for extension (adding new payment methods) but closed for modification.</p>
<p><strong>3. Booch's Metrics:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cohesion:</strong> The Payment class has low cohesion since it handles multiple methods of payment. By splitting each payment method into its own class, we can increase cohesion. <br><strong>Coupling:</strong> The classes are tightly coupled in some areas, for example, the User class has a direct reference to Cart. Utilizing dependency inversion and injecting dependencies can reduce this coupling.</p>
<p><strong>4. Design Patterns:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Factory Method Pattern:</strong> The `Payment` class is currently responsible for handling multiple payment methods. As the system grows and more payment methods are introduced, this class might become too complex and harder to maintain. A better approach would be to utilize the Factory Method pattern to create payment objects. <br>For this scenario, we can introduce a `PaymentFactory` that provides a method to create a `PaymentMethod` object based on the payment type the user selects. Each specific payment method (CreditCard, PayPal, Bitcoin) would be a subclass of the `PaymentMethod` class. This design makes it easier to add or remove payment methods without altering existing code and ensures each payment method has a single responsibility.<br><strong>Strategy Pattern for Payment:</strong> Instead of having multiple methods within the Payment class, introduce a PaymentStrategy interface and create individual classes for CreditCard, PayPal, and Bitcoin that implement this interface. The Payment class can then use the appropriate strategy based on the user's choice.</p>
