<p>This video will cover Architectural Design Patterns, a critical segment in the realm of software design. Architectural design patterns provide high-level strategies for organizing codebases, ensuring that software is scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to evolving requirements. In this video, we'll delve into four predominant patterns, each with its unique approach to structuring applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Layered Architecture Pattern</strong>: A staple in software design, this pattern organizes code into layers, each responsible for specific functions like presentation, business logic, or data access. These distinct layers promote separation of concerns, making applications more maintainable and scalable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern</strong>: A widely adopted pattern for designing web applications and GUIs. MVC segregates an application into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (presentation), and Controller (logic). This clear division facilitates easier testing, maintenance, and scalability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Microservices Pattern</strong>: This architecture pattern breaks down applications into small, independent services that run as separate processes. Each service is responsible for distinct functionality and communicates via lightweight mechanisms, like HTTP/REST. The approach is celebrated for its scalability, resilience, and flexibility in adopting new technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Event-Driven Architecture Pattern</strong>: This pattern is built around the production, detection, and reaction to events. Components in this architecture loosely communicate through events, promoting scalability and flexibility. It's particularly effective for systems that require real-time responsiveness and adaptability.</p>
