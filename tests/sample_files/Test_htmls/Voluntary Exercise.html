<h3>Exercise: Identifying Design Patterns in Real-world Projects</h3>
<p>Your task will be to identify, analyze, and document the use of design patterns within the chosen GitHub project.</p>
<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pattern Identification:</strong> As you study the code, look out for implementations that seem to match known design patterns. Identify at least three such design patterns used in the project.</li>
<li><strong>UML Diagrams:</strong> For each of the design patterns you identify, create a UML diagram that captures how the pattern has been implemented in the code. Ensure your diagram represents classes, relationships, methods, and other relevant components clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern Analysis:</strong> For each pattern, provide a brief analysis that covers:
<ul>
<li><em>Purpose:</em> Why do you believe this pattern was used in the design? What problem does it solve within the context of the project?</li>
<li><em>Consequences:</em> Discuss the consequences of using this pattern. How does it affect different quality attributes of the system?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, the goal is not just to identify patterns but also to understand their role in the context of a real-world application. This will deepen your appreciation of the practical applications of design patterns and help bridge the gap between theory and practice.&nbsp;Test your understanding with one of the other members of your project group and form a deeper understanding of design patterns together.</p>
